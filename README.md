# 🚦 Traffic Signal Optimization using GA and GOA

This project optimizes traffic signal timings on a real road network using two metaheuristic algorithms: **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** and **Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA)**.
The system integrates real-world datasets and a simulation-based traffic model to minimize total delay, especially for ambulance routing scenarios.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Load real traffic dataset and preprocess hourly traffic patterns
2. Build a road network graph from shapefiles
3. Simulate traffic flow using queue-based modeling
4. Introduce realistic dynamics:

   * Peak bursts in traffic
   * Nonlinear congestion
   * Signal delays
5. Optimize signal timings using GA and GOA
6. Compare performance with baseline methods

> Since the problem is simulation-based, dynamic traffic conditions are introduced to better observe the impact of optimization.
